# Diffie-Hellman chat


A pet-project, just to learn how the famous Diffie-Hellman algorithm works. It targets to provide two executables: __server__ and __client__. Server can be considered as a "public space", responsible for connecting pairs of clients and transfer their encrypted messages. Client can be considered as a classical "actor" in the algorithm data exchange process.

The project is built on Go 1.22
